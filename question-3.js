/*
What is the Big O notation for Function findStudentById . Explain your reason.
Answer: BigO of findStudentById is O(n), Consider of loop do only once that make linear search have high efficiently for small datasets


*/

/* 
What is the Big O notation for Function findProductPrice. Explain your reason.
Answer: BigO of findProductPrice is O(log n), Beacase everytime of looping they divide array length by half that make high efficiently for big datasets


*/

/* 
Which function is more efficient and why?
Answer: findProductPrice is more efficient. Because if they have the same dataset which is large and result is not in the beginning of the datasets,
Time looping of linear search is more, In the moment of binary search is half making it more faster
